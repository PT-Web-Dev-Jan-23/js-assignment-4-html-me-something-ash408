	       <h2>Birth</h2>

	       <p>
	       I suppose it goes without saying that I don't remember much about this time, but I do know that I was born to a
	       fairly large house, handmade by my parents if you can believe it, with plenty of siblings. I've been told that
	       I was fairly easy to raise at this age all things considered, seems I wasn't a particularly fussy baby.

	       <h2>Childhood</h2>

	       <p>
	       We never wanted for food growing up thankfully, and though my family was strictly vegan it never bothered me much. 
	       This is particularly good news considering that's mostly what I remember doing at this age, I must have been doing 
	       a lot of growing because I had a constant appetite. I never really spent a whole lot of time outside in these 
	       years, though that was fairly typical in my family. Definitely a lot of growing pains around this time, that's for 
	       sure.

	       <h2>Teen</h2>

	       <p>
	       As is typical I had a lot of personal development in this time of my life. It was a rough road, a lot of isolation 
	       and self reflection. I cut myself off from a lot of my family during this time, in fact I didn't really see much 
	       of anyone. I like to think back on it now as a necessary part of my growth as a being, and all in all I'd say it 
	       was definitely worth the trouble.

	       <h2>Adult</h2>

	       <p>
	       After finally coming out of the shell of my teen years, I was ready to really start my life. I had spent so much 
	       time at home it was time for me to head out on my own. It was pretty scary at first without the safety of family 
	       but with time I came into my own, and even built a little house of my own. In the end I couldn't get away from 
	       my roots, and ended up settling down and starting a little family for myself.
